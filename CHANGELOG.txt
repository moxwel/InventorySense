--------------------

 [ Version 1.2 ]

    Jappa's texture update to block container slots (only "N" branch).
        Now, the block textures are updated to the textures of Minecraft 1.14.

    Note about version branches:
        - The "N" branch refers to the NEW updated textures of Minecraft.
        - The "C" branch refers to the all-time vanilla CLASSIC textures.

        I made this separation because the new textures only are in 1.14,
        and for example, playing with the "N" branch in 1.13 may be anoying
        for some people and inconsistent, unless you use a resource pack to
        bring the new textures to other versions of Minecraft.
        So, I recommend use the "N" branch with versions post 1.14, and "C"
        branch to versions pre 1.14, like 1.8 or 1.12, etc.

    Villager trade interface enhanced.
        Now the villager trade interface is more intuitive, with a chat globe for
        the trades, and the EXP bar turns blue when reached max level.

    New panorama background to all versions of Minecraft.
        Now all the versions will have the latest panorama background of 1.14.

    Fixed bug to version in pack mcmeta for 1.8.
        Now appears, sorry :P
